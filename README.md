# Boulevard Bites

Story: Boulevard Bites is a restaurant review series, in which writers review restaurants on prominent boulevards near UCLA, including Sunset Boulevard, Wilshire Boulevard, etc.

Description: I was hoping to get a flat page for all of the articles that show where the are along the boulevards.  However, I don't want to do a regular map that we have done in the past for series like Flavors of Westwood.  I'm hoping to do something similar to a map but something that also really highlights the boulevards.  Maybe we could make them a lot bigger and highlight them with the background faded?

Deadline: There's no specific due date, but we already have 4 published, so I would like to get it done soon.

Reason for this request: I think the flat page would make looking at the reviews more user friendly and help students see where they are along the boulevards.
